## What is DiaryBeast?

**DiaryBeast** is a Web3-powered journaling app that gamifies daily writing through a virtual pet companion. Every time you write a diary entry, you feed your beast, earn tokens, and unlock customizations. Miss a day, and your beast loses health‚Äîcreating a playful accountability system for building a journaling habit.

Unlike traditional journaling apps, DiaryBeast leverages blockchain technology to:
- **Encrypt your entries** with your wallet (only you can read them)
- **Reward you with tokens** that you actually own and can spend
- **Create verifiable proof** of your writing consistency

---

## The Problem We're Solving

### Traditional Journaling Apps Fail Because:

1. **No Real Ownership**
   - Your entries are stored on someone else's server
   - If the company shuts down, you lose everything
   - No true privacy‚Äîcompanies can read your thoughts

2. **Weak Motivation**
   - Streaks are just numbers; no tangible reward
   - Easy to abandon without consequences
   - No fun or playfulness to keep you engaged

3. **Privacy Concerns**
   - Entries analyzed for ads
   - Data sold to third parties
   - No encryption means vulnerable to hacks

### DiaryBeast's Solution:

‚úÖ **True Ownership:** Your entries are encrypted with your wallet‚Äîonly you can decrypt them
‚úÖ **Real Rewards:** Earn DIARY tokens you can spend in the app (not just fake points)
‚úÖ **Gamified Accountability:** Your pet's health depends on your consistency
‚úÖ **Blockchain Proof:** Your writing history is verifiable on-chain (encrypted, but provable)

---

## How It Works

### 1. Connect Your Wallet
Create a free Coinbase wallet in seconds. No passwords, no personal info‚Äîjust your wallet address.

### 2. Choose Your Beast
Pick between a **Cat** or **Dog** companion. Your beast starts with 7 lives and will be your journaling partner.

### 3. Write Daily
Open the app, write about your day, thoughts, or goals. One entry per day. Content is encrypted before leaving your device.

### 4. Earn DIARY Tokens
Every entry earns you **10 DIARY tokens**. First entry? **50 bonus tokens**. 7-day streak? **100 bonus tokens**.

### 5. Customize & Grow
Spend tokens in the shop to buy backgrounds, themes, and (in future versions) pet accessories, music, and more.

### 6. Maintain Your Streak
Miss a day? Your beast loses 1 life. Keep writing to restore health and build the longest streak possible.

## Technology Philosophy

### Blockchain: When It Makes Sense
We use Web3 for:
- **Ownership:** DIARY tokens are on-chain
- **Rewards:** Mint/burn operations need blockchain
- **Proof:** Verify writing consistency

We DON'T overuse blockchain:
- Entry content stored in database (encrypted, not on-chain‚Äîtoo expensive)
- UI state managed client-side (no need for blockchain)

### Privacy-First Design
- **Zero-knowledge:** We don't know what you write
- **No analytics by default:** Opt-in only
- **No ads, ever:** Your journal is sacred

### Open Source (Planned)
- Smart contracts: Open-source from day 1
- Frontend: Open-source after Beta
- Community contributions welcome
