## AsciiPet Component

The AsciiPet component renders animated virtual pets using ASCII art with different emotional states and life stages. It supports both cat and dog characters with distinct animations for various states including idle, happy, sad, critical, eating, playing, and sleeping.

### Props
The component accepts the following props:

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| animal | "cat" \| "dog" | Yes | Specifies the type of pet to display |
| state | PetState | Yes | Current emotional/action state of the pet |
| className | string | No | Additional CSS classes to apply to the component |

The PetState type includes: idle, happy, sad, critical, eating, playing, sleeping, kitten, young, adult, gen2.

### Animation System
The AsciiPet component uses a frame-based animation system with configurable frame durations and loop behavior. Each animation state consists of multiple frames that are cycled through at specified intervals. The animation speed and behavior are defined in the animation configuration files.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
[*] --> Idle
Idle --> Happy : Pet happiness >= 70
Idle --> Sad : Pet happiness < 30
Idle --> Critical : Lives = 0
Happy --> Eating : Feed action
Happy --> Playing : Play action
Eating --> Idle : Animation complete
Playing --> Idle : Animation complete
Sleeping --> Idle : Wake up
```

## DailyTimer Component

The DailyTimer component displays a countdown timer showing the time remaining until the next diary entry deadline. It provides visual feedback based on whether the user has already written an entry today.

### Props
The component accepts a single prop:

| Prop | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| hasWrittenToday | boolean | Yes | Indicates whether the user has written an entry today |

### Visual States
The component has two distinct visual states:

1. **Time Remaining**: When hasWrittenToday is false, the component displays an urgent warning with a pulsing animation and clock emoji, showing the countdown to the next entry deadline.

2. **Entry Claimed**: When hasWrittenToday is true, the component displays a success message with a checkmark emoji, followed by the countdown to the next available entry.

### Implementation Details
The component uses the useEffect hook to set up a timer that updates every second. It calculates the time remaining until the next midnight UTC, which serves as the entry deadline. The time is displayed in hours, minutes, and seconds with proper zero-padding.

```mermaid

## Component Composition and State Management

The UI components are designed to work together through a centralized state management system using Zustand. The pet's state is managed in a global store that coordinates interactions between components.

### State Management Architecture
The application uses a Zustand store (petStore) to manage the pet's state, including lives, happiness, cooldowns, and animation state. This store serves as the single source of truth for the pet's status.

```mermaid
graph TD
A[Pet Component] --> B[petStore]
C[FoodSelectModal] --> B
D[CriticalLifeModal] --> B
E[LifeCheckWrapper] --> B
B --> F[API Endpoints]
F --> B
B --> G[UI Components]
```

**Diagram sources**
- [lib/stores/petStore.ts](file://lib/stores/petStore.ts#L1-L235)
- [components/Pet.tsx](file://components/Pet.tsx#L1-L388)
- [components/LifeCheckWrapper.tsx](file://components/LifeCheckWrapper.tsx#L1-L60)

### Data Flow
The data flow follows a unidirectional pattern:

1. User interactions trigger actions in the UI components
2. Components dispatch actions to the petStore
3. The store updates state and makes API calls as needed
4. API responses update the store state
5. Components re-render based on the updated state

This pattern ensures predictable state changes and makes debugging easier.

### Integration Points
The components integrate with the state management system at key points:

- **AsciiPet**: Reads the pet's state from the store to determine which animation to display
- **DailyTimer**: Independent of pet state but contributes to the overall engagement metrics
- **CriticalLifeModal**: Listens for critical state changes in the petStore
- **FoodSelectModal**: Triggers feed actions in the petStore when food is selected

- [components/LifeCheckWrapper.tsx](file://components/LifeCheckWrapper.tsx#L1-L60)

## Storybook Integration

The UI components are fully integrated with Storybook for visual testing, documentation, and development.

### Story Configuration
Each component has a corresponding Storybook file that defines multiple stories showcasing different states and configurations:

```typescript
const meta = {
  title: 'Components/AsciiPet',
  component: AsciiPet,
  parameters: {
    layout: 'centered',
    backgrounds: {
      default: 'dark',
    },
  },
  tags: ['autodocs'],
  argTypes: {
    animal: {
      control: 'select',
      options: ['cat', 'dog'],
    },
    state: {
      control: 'select',
      options: ['idle', 'happy', 'sad', 'critical', 'eating', 'playing', 'sleeping'],
    },
  },
} satisfies Meta<typeof AsciiPet>;
```

### Available Stories
The components have the following stories defined:

- **AsciiPet**: Multiple stories for each animal type and state combination
- **DailyTimer**: Two stories showing both "Time Remaining" and "Entry Claimed" states
- **CriticalLifeModal**: Three stories showing different life states (2, 1, and 0 lives)
- **FoodSelectModal**: Not currently implemented in Storybook

The stories are configured with appropriate backgrounds and layout settings to showcase the components effectively.

### Usage for Development
Storybook provides several benefits for component development:

1. **Isolated Testing**: Components can be tested in isolation without needing the full application context.

2. **Visual Documentation**: The stories serve as living documentation showing how components should look and behave.

3. **Prop Exploration**: The controls panel allows developers to easily explore different prop combinations.

4. **Design System**: Storybook helps maintain consistency across components by providing a centralized place to view and test UI elements.

## Responsive Design and Accessibility

The UI components are designed to be responsive and accessible across different devices and user needs.

### Responsive Design
The components use Tailwind CSS's responsive utilities to adapt to different screen sizes:

- **Mobile First**: The components are designed with mobile devices in mind, using appropriate touch targets and spacing.
- **Flexible Layouts**: The components use flexbox and grid layouts that adapt to available space.
- **Scalable Typography**: Font sizes use relative units that scale appropriately on different devices.
- **Viewport Awareness**: The components consider viewport dimensions and adjust layout when necessary.

### Accessibility Features
The components implement several accessibility best practices:

1. **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements are accessible via keyboard navigation with proper focus management.

2. **ARIA Labels**: Appropriate ARIA attributes are used to provide context for screen readers.

3. **Color Contrast**: The color palette meets WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements for text and interactive elements.

4. **Semantic HTML**: The components use appropriate HTML elements (buttons, headings, etc.) for their purpose.

5. **Focus Indicators**: Visible focus indicators are provided for keyboard navigation.

6. **Reduced Motion**: The components respect the user's preference for reduced motion through the prefers-reduced-motion media query.

### Implementation Examples
```tsx
// Example of accessible button implementation
<button
  onClick={handleFeedClick}
  disabled={!petStore.canFeed || actionInProgress || livesRemaining >= 7}
  aria-label={livesRemaining >= 7 ? "Pet is at maximum health" : petStore.canFeed ? "Feed your pet" : `Feed available in ${formatCooldown(petStore.feedCooldownRemaining)}`}
  className="w-full px-3 py-2 bg-transparent hover:bg-primary/10 disabled:bg-transparent disabled:text-disabled disabled:border-inactive border border-primary/40 hover:border-primary disabled:hover:border-inactive text-primary rounded font-mono text-xs transition-all flex items-center justify-between group hover:shadow-glow-cyan disabled:shadow-none"

## Theming with Tailwind CSS

The UI components leverage Tailwind CSS for consistent theming and styling across the application.

### Color Palette
The components use a defined color palette that includes:

- **Primary**: Cyan-based colors for main UI elements
- **Success**: Green colors for positive states
- **Warning**: Orange colors for cautionary states
- **Error**: Red colors for critical states
- **Accent**: Yellow/green colors for special highlights
- **Backgrounds**: Dark theme colors for backgrounds and cards

The color classes are applied using Tailwind's utility-first approach, allowing for easy customization.

### Typography
The components use a consistent typography system:

- **Font Family**: Monospace font for a retro Tamagotchi feel
- **Font Sizes**: Responsive font sizes using Tailwind's text utilities
- **Font Weights**: Bold and regular weights for visual hierarchy
- **Line Height**: Appropriate line height for readability

### Spacing and Layout
The components follow a consistent spacing system using Tailwind's spacing scale:

- **Padding**: Consistent padding values (p-2, p-3, p-4, etc.)
- **Margins**: Appropriate margins for component separation
- **Gap**: Consistent gap values for flex and grid layouts
- **Border Radius**: Rounded corners using Tailwind's border utilities

### Customization
The theming can be customized by:

1. **Extending Tailwind**: Adding custom colors, spacing, or typography to the Tailwind configuration.

2. **CSS Variables**: Using CSS variables for theming that can be overridden at runtime.

3. **Theme Classes**: Applying theme-specific classes to components.

4. **Dark/Light Mode**: Implementing theme switching by toggling between different class sets.

## Performance Optimization

The UI components include several performance optimizations, particularly for animation-heavy components like AsciiPet.

### Animation Optimization
The AsciiPet component implements several performance optimizations:

1. **Efficient Animation Loop**: Uses setInterval with proper cleanup in useEffect to prevent memory leaks.

2. **Conditional Animation**: Skips animation setup when there is only one frame in the animation sequence.

3. **Memoization**: The animation data is memoized and only recalculated when props change.

4. **Frame Rate Control**: Animation frame duration is optimized to balance smoothness and performance.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
A[Component Mount] --> B{Multiple Frames?}
B --> |No| C[Render Static Frame]
B --> |Yes| D[Set Up Interval]
D --> E[Update Frame Index]
E --> F[Render Frame]
F --> G{Last Frame?}
G --> |Loop| E
G --> |No Loop| H[Stop Animation]
I[Component Unmount] --> J[Clear Interval]
```

- [lib/ascii/types.ts](file://lib/ascii/types.ts#L1-L150)

### Rendering Optimization
Additional performance optimizations include:

1. **React.memo**: Components are wrapped with React.memo where appropriate to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

2. ** useCallback**: Event handlers are memoized with useCallback to prevent recreation on every render.

3. **Code Splitting**: Components are imported individually to enable code splitting.

4. **Lazy Loading**: Heavy components can be lazy-loaded when needed.

5. **Efficient State Updates**: The petStore uses optimized state updates to minimize re-renders.

### Best Practices
The components follow React performance best practices:

- **Key Prop**: Proper use of the key prop in lists and animations
- **Avoid Inline Functions**: Minimizing inline function creation in render
- **Optimal useEffect Dependencies**: Careful selection of useEffect dependencies
- **Cleanup Effects**: Proper cleanup of intervals and subscriptions
